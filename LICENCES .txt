i also used the .vbs file from the uefi-simple repo.

the rest of the code is free to use, distribiute, modify or whatever.

i do not laim that the software is functional or wroks on every system.
by using the software you agree that you are aware of the risks that runing code from the internet brngs with it and accept it.
if you modify the software i have no responsibility for any outcomes of running that software.

(i am not good at writing stuff like that. pls have mercy. )
i will improve/clarify this text in the future but the general meaning will be the same.
the software will allways stay
-open source
-free to use
-free to distribute
-free to modify
-free to sell

just include a refference to this repo
